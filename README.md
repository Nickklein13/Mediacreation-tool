<p>
And finally, choose to use a "USB flash drive" (here it will remind you for a final time you need 8gb of room. After you select that, it'll have you choose a specific usb drive, so if you have multiple USB storage devices plugged in, please take the time to double check the name of the one you want Windows copied too.

<p>
The software will now begin to write the OS to your USB device. This process can take a little bit depending on your computer, however it does tell you that you can continue to use your PC while it writes in the background.
